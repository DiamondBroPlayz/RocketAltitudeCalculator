# Rocket Altitude Calculator

This python project will detect how far your rocket will go and show you some extra statistics!

# Dependencies

Most of these dependencies are pre-packaged with Python, but I'll still list them:
Math,
Shutil,
Os,
Time,
Random,
Pyfiglet,
also these names have no capitals.
